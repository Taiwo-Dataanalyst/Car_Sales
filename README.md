## Conclusion and recommendations

- Focus on High-Performing Brands:
The data indicates that 89.3% of the total sales came from five brands: Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai. Concentrating marketing efforts, inventory, and promotions on these high-performing brands can maximize sales and profitability. Additionally, maintaining a diverse range of models for these brands will likely continue to drive high sales volumes.

- Expand Model Variety:
Brands with multiple models tend to have higher sales volumes. Expanding the variety of models within high-performing brands can cater to different consumer preferences and needs, potentially increasing sales. Special attention should be given to introducing models that appeal to different segments.

- Target Female Consumers:
Since more females bought cars than males, marketing campaigns should be tailored to appeal to female buyers. This can include highlighting features such as safety, reliability, fuel efficiency, and convenience features that are often prioritized by female consumers.

- Age Group Marketing:
The 26-35 age group is the most active in purchasing cars. Marketing strategies should be designed to appeal specifically to this demographic, focusing on their lifestyle, preferences, and financial capabilities. Utilizing digital marketing, social media, and targeted advertisements can effectively reach this age group.

- Geographical Focus:
Lagos State, having the highest volume of sales, should continue to be a primary focus for sales activities. More resources should be allocated to maintain and grow market share in Lagos. Conversely, strategies should be developed to boost sales in states with lower volumes, like Ekiti, perhaps through localized promotions or dealership expansions.

- Seasonal Promotions:
December has the highest sales volume, indicating a seasonal peak, possibly due to end-of-year bonuses, holiday purchases, and new model releases. Leveraging this trend, dealerships should plan major sales events, promotions, and new model launches in December to capitalize on increased consumer spending during this period.

## Conclusion:
The analysis reveals several key insights that can drive strategic decisions and improve overall sales performance. The dominance of a few brands in total sales volume highlights the importance of focusing on top-performing brands and expanding their model offerings. The significant role of female consumers and the 26-35 age demographic suggests targeted marketing strategies to cater to these groups. Geographical sales trends emphasize the need for localized marketing and sales efforts, particularly focusing on high-volume areas like Lagos State while finding innovative ways to boost sales in lower-volume areas. Lastly, recognizing the seasonal peak in December can guide the planning of promotional activities to maximize end-of-year sales. By implementing these recommendations, the business can enhance its market position, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.
